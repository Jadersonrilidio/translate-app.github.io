Despite no previous knowledge on the Yandex API use, it was possible to check some code incompatibilities, as follow in the file TranslationYandex.php in this repository;

Most of comments and insertions (code fixing, refactoring, etc) were made in the file TranslationYandex.php;

The Yandex APIs are well documented and easy to learn, thus it turns out that with a few time and training it's perfectly possible for complete learning and applying in future projects.
